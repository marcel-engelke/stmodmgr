## stmodmgr
### Stellaris Mod Manager
A simple python script that allows the non-Steam version of the game (GOG etc.) to install mods from the Steam workshop.

It is only intended to be used on *nix platforms as Windows has other tools available for this task.

#### Usage:
```
$ ./stmodmgr [FLAGS] [OPERATION] [MOD_ID]
```
See `--help` for additional information.

#### Requirements:
- python3
- steamcmd (an account is not required)
